Gym Stats is a web app that allows the user to see nearby workout studios (currently hard-coded to D.C.), a quick review of each studio, it's location, and a quick graph of the current population of the gym.

The idea originated from an actual problem I had when I first moved to D.C.: I wanted to find a nearby workout studio that had good reviews but also wasn't going to be packed all the time.
